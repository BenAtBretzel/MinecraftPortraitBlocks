## Minecraft Bedrock Add-on: Portrait Blocks

Created for the October 2024 Adelaide Elementary Career Fair.

Based upon (Custom Blocks Part 1: The Simplest Block)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/addcustomdieblock?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable], a tutorial from Microsoft on adding a die/dice block to the game, this add-on allows taking pictures from a connected camera and putting that picture onto a new Minecraft block.  Most of the files in this repository are direct copies or are derived from those in that tutorial.  

This add-on introduces the Python script (fair.py)[fair.py] to add and remove blocks easily.  Please see that file for me details and descriptions of how this all works.
